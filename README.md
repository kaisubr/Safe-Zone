Problem: Millions of Americans are quarantined at home, away from the outside world, and a global supply shortage creates the threat of hunger for many unemployed people.

What do we know? Over % of cases are only in large cities, like New York. As lockdowns will slowly be lifted, there are several zones of few COVID-19 cases, where non-infected people can start to feel safer. People can meet up to trade supplies or enjoy the environment, such as parks and the great outdoors.

Solution: SafeZone discovers zones with few cases, and implements an accurate contact-tracing method to generate a network of people that you contact, simply through a Bluetooth exchange of anonymous IDs.



If someone begins to feel symptoms of COVID-19, all they hve to do is update their profile, which sends an alert to everyone they've contacted, warning them to stay home and prevent further spread of the virus.

The network that is generated carries valuable data for insurers. The level of exposure to the virus can be used to predict assessment for life insurance policies. A machine leaening model that accepts parameters for level of exposure to COVID-19 as a medical factor, can be used for this task.
