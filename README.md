## Problem
The spread of COVID-19 is difficult to quantify.
* The unknown spread of the virus makes it difficult for insurers to provide accurate life insurance quotes during this time. 
* A shortage of food and increased chaos during this time create problems in accurately tracing the movement of infected people.
* There are several _zones_ with _few_ COVID-19 cases, where healthy people can start to feel safer, once lockdown restrictions are lifted. 
* Healthy people can meet up at these zones, to trade supplies or enjoy the environment -- such as parks and the great outdoors.

## Solution
* SafeZone discovers zones with few cases, and implements an accurate **contact-tracing method** to generate a network of people that you contact, simply through a Bluetooth exchange of anonymous IDs. Once lockdown restrictions are lifted, non-infected people can travel to safe-zones and interact with others, without feeling anxious.
<!--If someone begins to feel symptoms of COVID-19, all they hve to do is update their profile, which sends an alert to everyone they've contacted, warning them to stay home and prevent further spread of the virus.-->

* The **tracing network** that is generated by this app, will carry valuable data for insurers. It directly quantifies an individual's **level of exposure** to the virus, which can be used to predict assessment for life insurance policies. A machine learning model that accepts parameters for level of exposure to COVID-19 as a medical factor, was used for predicting quotes on life insurance.
