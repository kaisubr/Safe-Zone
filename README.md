## Problem
People are confined at home due to fears of COVID-19. The unknown spread of the virus makes it difficult for insurers to provide accurate life insurance quotes during this time. A shortage of food, and increased chaos all create problems in accurately tracing the movement of infected people.

## What do we know? 
Most of cases are limited to large cities, like New York, so there are several _zones_ with few COVID-19 cases, where non-infected people can start to feel safer, once lockdown restrictions are lifted. People can meet up to trade supplies or enjoy the environment, such as parks and the great outdoors.

## Solution
SafeZone discovers zones with few cases, and implements an accurate contact-tracing method to generate a network of people that you contact, simply through a Bluetooth exchange of anonymous IDs.  Non-infected people can travel to safe-zones and interact with others, without feeling anxious.
<!--If someone begins to feel symptoms of COVID-19, all they hve to do is update their profile, which sends an alert to everyone they've contacted, warning them to stay home and prevent further spread of the virus.-->

The tracing network that is generated by this app, will carry valuable data for insurers. The potential _level of exposure_ to the virus can be used to predict assessment for life insurance policies. A machine learning model that accepts parameters for level of exposure to COVID-19 as a medical factor, was used for predicting quotes on life insurance.
